# APTProject
Final Project for ECE 4122/6122 (Advanced Programming Techniques)

Instructions to Run
NOTE: WE RECOMMEND USING CLION; ALSO THIS SETUP HAS BEEN TESTED FOR WINDOWS OS
(1) Open up PuzzleGL as a project using CLion (either import from sources or open existing project)
(2) Click Build->Clean
(3) Click either Build->Run or click the Debug Run button (Debug button is recommended) to make sure no suppression of stdout occurs
(4) If you want to verify level hierarchy and such, go to PuzzleGL/main.cpp and set the variable DEBUG_MODE to 1 instead of the default 0
